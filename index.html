            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I started learning to code when I was 17 years old because of my course in Information Technology.
                I never really had a particular drive or dream to program to the extent that I almost gave up. Over time,
                I decided to pick up the pace and motivate myself to code until I discovered web development.

            <h3>Graphic Design & Art</h3>
            <p>I started drawing ever since I was young. In 2016, I met a friend who inspired me to dive deeper into art. Since then,
                I have bought art materials, graphite pencils, sketchbooks, coloring materials, and more. In 2019, I discovered digital
                art. It has been my primary medium, and I started with a mouse to draw. It wasn't easy until I earned enough money to buy a tablet.
                My passion for drawing has introduced me to different disciplines, not only limited to sketching but also layouts and designing.

            <h3>Poetry</h3>
            <p>One of my favorite pastimes is writing poetry. I don't remember the last time I wrote poems but writing poems wires my brain
                to think and be more imaginative in creatively using words. As an artist, I also wanted to be creative in writing. Whenever I 
                feel surges of emotions, anger, love, happiness, fear, etc. I write poems to express myself creatively.
